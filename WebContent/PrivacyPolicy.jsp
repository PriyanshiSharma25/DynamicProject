<h4>To be transparent with your users about what personal information you collect and what you do with it, you are required to publish a Privacy Policy agreement on your website or give in-app access to it.

Websites usually post a link to the complete Privacy Policy agreement from the footer of the website, whereas apps generally add the Privacy Policy to an "About" or "Legal" menu.

Another popular location for ecommerce store apps and websites is the checkout page, or account registration page if you don't have an ecommerce component but allow users to create accounts.
Your Privacy Policy must be accurate and easily comprehensible, with all the necessary information required by laws and for transparency.

Generally speaking, every Privacy Policy agreement should have at least the following clauses:

What information is collected and how
How is the information used
How is the information stored and protected
Company contact information
Use of cookies, log files and tracking
How a user can opt out of data collection/usage
Privacy Policy agreements inform users what information is collected from them. This includes information users voluntarily and actively provide when they register to use services, as well as information that may be collected from them automatically, such as through the use of cookies.


You can define how you classify information e.g. public, private, or personal information. This helps the user know exactly what these terms means in the rest of the Privacy Policy document.
Here's an example of how you can construct a clause to explain this information to your users:
Another important clause to include in your Privacy Policy agreement is about how you store and protect the information you collect from your site's visitors. You can explain the different ways you store information and what measures you take to protect that information.
